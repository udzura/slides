Okay, this is a very comprehensive and well-structured script! It tells a great story about the development process. Here are some suggestions for minor improvements to make it sound even more natural in American English and polish a few rough edges:

**General Notes:**

*   **Contractions:** Use contractions like "it's," "don't," "can't," "I'm" freely in spoken American English for a natural flow. Your script already does this well in many places.
*   **Code/Technical Terms:** Consistently use backticks (`) for code elements, function names, commands, and file formats (`Wast`, `gem install Wardite`, `path_open`, `i32`).
*   **Emphasis:** Where you might use bold or italics in writing, plan to use vocal emphasis during delivery.
*   **Transitions:** You have good transitions, but a few could be slightly smoother.

**Specific Suggestions:**

1.  **Introduction:**
    *   `My name is Kondo. I'm from Fukuoka, Japan *and I'm* a Product Engineer at SmartHR, which is *a* Ruby Kaigi *platinum* sponsor.` (Add "I'm" for flow, add "a", correct spelling of "platinum").

2.  **What is Wardite?**
    *   `Because it's a standard Ruby Gem, you can simply *run* \`gem install Wardite\` and start using it.` (Slightly more active phrasing for running a command).
    *   `You can run existing Wasm tools, or, more powerfully, load and interact with Wasm modules directly from your Ruby code, using Wardite as a library.` (Perfect).

3.  **Wasm Context:**
    *   `Think of it as a portable compilation target *for* compilers, such as rustc or clang.` (Use "for" instead of "of").
    *   `Browsers have built-in runtimes, *and* there are standalone ones like Wasmtime or WasmEdge...` (Add "and" for smoother connection).
    *   `For example, *WasmZero* is a Wasm runtime written in Go...` (Correct name).

4.  **Wardite Specifics:**
    *   `No external C dependencies or gems.` (Clear and impactful).
    *   `WebAssembly Core Spec covers the fundamental instruction set...` (Good explanation).
    *   `Crucially, Wardite also implements WASI... specifically the common Preview 1 version.` (Good).
    *   `including, excitingly, Ruby itself compiled to Wasm.` (Great point!).

5.  **Why Build This?**
    *   `So, why *did* I *build* this?` (Past tense sounds slightly more natural for a completed action).
    *   `First: *I wanted to* Expand Ruby + Wasm Integration...` (Making these full sentences sounds a bit more formal, but bullet points are fine for slides/speech).
    *   `Then: *I wanted* High Portability...`
    *   `Finally: *I wanted to* Leverage Wasm's Strengths into *the* Ruby ecosystem.` (Add "the").

6.  **Wasm Strengths Section:**
    *   `And crucially, C support potentially allows...` -> `Crucially, C support potentially allows...` (Starting with "And" is okay conversationally, but "Crucially" is strong enough alone).
    *   `Also *it's* Embeddable & Portable:` -> `Also, it's...` (Add comma).
    *   `And finally, it *enables* Polyglot Systems...` (Lowercase 'e').
    *   `to build applications *by combining* components written in different languages...` (Slightly better flow than just "by").

7.  **Transition:**
    *   `Now that you understand *Wardite's* background, *let's* dive deeper.` (Add possessive apostrophe, fix contraction).

8.  **Development Process - GorillaBook:**
    *   `The first milestone was porting *concepts from* a *resource* called GorillaBook...` ("work" is a bit vague, "resource" or "book" is clearer. "porting concepts from" clarifies you didn't port Rust code directly).
    *   `Since I happened to have an opportunity to study it, I *decided to try implementing it*...` ("writing it out" is a bit vague).
    *   `My impression was that it's an excellent book, but understanding the overall design philosophy of the VM was quite challenging.` (Good).

9.  **Development Process - VM Internals:**
    *   `This snippet is almost *actual* Wardite code.` ("actual" sounds slightly more natural than "real" here).
    *   `So, I implemented this as well, *and* having the book made it manageable.` (Add "and").

10. **Development Process - Instructions:**
    *   `At this point, I *started thinking about running* Ruby Wasm.` (Slightly stronger than "had a slight desire").
    *   `Surprisingly, *it turned out there were* about 167 such generated instructions.` ("apparently" sounds a bit uncertain).

11. **Development Process - Debugging Grayscale:**
    *   `The fix was just one line, but it took some hard *effort*.` (Singular "effort").
    *   `This revealed the error message: "Corrupted deflate stream."` (Good).
    *   `Now I had *an error message*. I looked at the Rust code.` ("error ID" is a bit specific unless it was literally an ID number).
    *   `"I see... I'm not sure."` (Relatable!).
    *   `I wondered if I had to study the Deflate algorithm from scratch, which felt a bit daunting.` (Good).

12. **Development Process - Test Suite:**
    *   `The official WebAssembly test suite is provided in a format called \`Wast\`.` (Use backticks).
    *   `Using a command called \`wast2json\`, you can generate JSON files...` (Backticks).
    *   `When I first ran the test cases related to \`i32\` operations, several tests failed, including bitshift instructions, as *I* somewhat expected.` (Add "I").

13. **Development Process - Ruby Wasm & WASI:**
    *   `This *encouraged me to try* something even more practical: Ruby dot Wasm.` ("raised the momentum" is slightly awkward phrasing).
    *   `As an example, implementing \`clock_time_get\` essentially just wraps Ruby's \`Time.now\`.` (Check WASI spec for exact function name casing - often `snake_case`).
    *   `My strategy was simple: - Repeatedly try to launch Ruby Wasm. - When it failed saying "function X is missing," - I implemented that function *and tried* again.` (Clarify the loop).
    *   `At this stage, Ruby's embedded core libraries worked, so things like \`times\` ran *correctly*.` ("somehow" sounds a bit uncertain).
    *   `To do this, Wardite needed *proper file system support*.` ("recognize the file system collectively" is slightly awkward).
    *   `Initially, I crudely tried to make \`path_open\` work...` (Check WASI spec for name).

14. **Development Process - Preopens:**
    *   `Why? Because I needed to correctly implement the Preopens mechanism first.` (Good).
    *   `*Let me explain the Preopens mechanism:*` (More direct than "To explain it in English").
    *   `must be passed via pre-register*ed* file descriptors.` (Past participle).
    *   `It continues this process... until it encounters *an* error.` (Add "an").
    *   `Actually, functions like \`path_open\` are implemented such that...` (Backticks).

15. **Development Process - Success & Performance Intro:**
    *   `After all *that*, standard Ruby started without any loading warnings.` (Add "that").
    *   `So, all's well that ends well. However...` (Good transition).

16. **Demo:**
    *   `But to digress briefly, I would like to present a startup demonstration.` (Good).
    *   `Note I run it with \`--disable-gems\`, *so* it should start up in about 10 seconds.` (Use "so" instead of "then").

17. **Performance - Block Jumps:**
    *   `When I profiled the very first implementation with RubyProf, a method called \`FetchOpsWhileEnd\` was consuming a lot of time.` (Backticks).
    *   `This reduced execution time by 43% for the grayscale benchmark. This *was* Wardite's first speed improvement.` (Past tense).

18. **Performance - Instance Creation:**
    *   `Profiling Wardite using perf identified bottlenecks in C functions like \`RubyVM#setivar\` and \`new_instance_pass_kw\`.` (Backticks).
    *   `Using tracepoints on the grayscale benchmark, I found it creates about 18.8 million \`i32\` objects.` (Backticks, impactful number!).

19. **Performance - TODOs:**
    *   `There are some more TODOs: for example, *Addressing* Ruby Wasm startup time:` (Better verb than "Breaking").
    *   `perhaps by using something like \`StringScanner\` to speed it up.` (Backticks).

20. **Performance - YJIT:**
    *   `How effective? On my Arm environment, compared to *running without* YJIT: Ruby 3.3 showed *X%* improvement, *and* 3.4 showed *Y%*.` (Be specific with numbers here or refer to a graph visually. Add "and").
    *   `Thank you always (to the YJIT team)!` (Nice touch).

21. **Conclusion:**
    *   `Running a Wasm runtime purely in Ruby still feels *like* quite a "bold" adventure in some ways.` (Add "like").
    *   `I'm going bold.` (Fun callback!).

This script is already very strong. These are mostly small tweaks to enhance clarity and natural flow for an American English audience. Good luck with your presentation!
